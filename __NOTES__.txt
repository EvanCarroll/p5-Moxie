mop::object
-----------

The construction protocol for mop::object expects that by runtime
you have already "compiled" all the neccessary meta information into 
the package. This is because it must be able to read all meta 
information using just package stash/glob operations only. 


Questions
---------

## Do we actually want to alias required methods?

There is value in knowing that a method was not defined in a package, 
meaning that it is not owned by that package. But is there value in 
knowing this when it comes to required methods? 

Required methods will get composed in from roles, and they will be 
inherited from abstract classes, but they are mostly just markers 
that something is missing. They can't conflict since their bodies
are always the same (NULL) and when you have two of the same name
it is the same as having one.
