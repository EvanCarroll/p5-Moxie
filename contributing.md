# Contributing

Specify that all contributions are welcome, but if you can't be nice and reasonable, you will be asked to leave. Model this somewhat on the p5p SoC.

If you truly have a stack in this and care, then you can be nice and reasonable about it, no meanness or jerkiness will be tolerated (this includes being mean or jerky to the jerks).

EVERYONE will be given a second chance, ... third/fourth/etc chances will be given at the discression of the project leaders.

Organize this into multiple categories

- just feedback

This is for people to just review the concepts and provide feedback on the sanity.

- help code, but only Perl

we have tests that need expansion

- help code, and know XS/C

specify bits to be converted to XS/C, but tests have to be good before that happens.

- help spec out core integration

must know the core really well, can discuss parts of core that can be modified to make this work more smoothly.
