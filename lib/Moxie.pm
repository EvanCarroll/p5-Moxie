# Everything that this &import method does should be
# in util subroutines so that someone else can just
# come in and use it sensibly to implement their own
# object system if they want. The idea is that the
# simple, bare bones sugar I provide here is just barely
# one step above the raw version which uses the package
# variables and MOP::Internal::Util::* methods directly
# inside BEGIN blocks, etc.
#
# In short, there is no need to make people jump through
# stupid meta-layer subclass stuff in order to maintain
# a level or purity that perl just doesn't give a fuck
# about anyway. In the 'age of objects' we have forgotten
# that subroutines are also an excellent form of encapsulation
# and re-use.

# NOTES:
# This is a rough "drawing" of the lifecycle for
# handling the options for the `has` keyword.
# Exactly how I will do this, we have to work out
# because the Moose/Class::MOP subclassing approach
# got really messy, and just having callback functions
# for traits means that we lose a lot of metadata.
# Need to find some way that is:
# 1) easy to implement new traits into any place in the workflow
# 2) does not lose the metadata generated
# 3) is able to mix-in cleanly with other MOP frontends
# 4) is not mind bendingly complex

                # is it required/abstract? is it locally defined?

Moxie

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    package Point {
        use Moxie;

        extends 'MOP::Object';

        has 'x' => (is => 'ro', default => sub { 0 });
        has 'y' => (is => 'ro', default => sub { 0 });

        sub clear ($self) {
            @{$self}{'x', 'y'} = (0, 0);
        }
    }

    package Point3D {
        use Moxie;

        extends 'Point';

        has 'z' => (is => 'ro', default => sub { 0 });

        sub clear ($self) {
            $self->next::method;
            $self->{'z'} = 0;
        }
    }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Moxie is a reference implemenation for an object system built
on top of the MOP. It is purposefully meant to be similar to
the Moose/Mouse/Moo style of classes, but with a number of
improvements as well.
